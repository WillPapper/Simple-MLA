The Simple MLA style for Ulysses III
------------------------------------
A Ulysses III style for simple MLA formatting by William Papper. The style was originally modified from Simple APA.

Note that you must change the $last-name value at the top of the document to your last name for page numbering to work. TextEdit can sometimes break the quotes, so make sure that it is "Lastname" and not “Lastname”. Copy and paste in the quotes manually from the first Lastname example if necessary, and use a different text editor.

For MLA formatting, you should use:
```
# for the title block
## for a centered title (if any) after the title block
### for the separate Works Cited page
#### for the citations on the Works Cited page
```
