The Simple MLA style for Ulysses III
------------------------------------
A Ulysses III style for simple MLA formatting by William Papper. The style was originally modified from Simple APA.

Note that you must change the $last-name value at the top of the document to your last name for page numbering to work.

For MLA formatting, you should use:
```
# for the title block
## for a centered title (if any) after the title block
### for the separate Works Cited page
#### for the citations on the Works Cited page
```
